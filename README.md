## Object 2

These sources are what I wrote for *A Series of Small Wire Objects (Many of them Uninteresting): Object 2*

Exhibited in late 2014 as part of *Experimenta: Recharge (6th Bienalle of Media Art)*

Sound design was a collaboration with Darrin Verhagen

pd patches modified from Stuart McFarlane's original work for *Object 1*
